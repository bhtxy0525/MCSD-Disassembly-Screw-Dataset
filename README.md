# MCSD-Disassembly-Screw-Dataset
We constructed a dedicated multi-class screw detection dataset, termed MCSD (Multi-Class Screw Detection).   The dataset contains 1240 images covering 12 screw categories, all annotated using LabelImg.   The parameter specifications of each screw type are summarized in Table 1.

The MCSD dataset presents the following challenges:  
**(1) inter-class similarity and intra-class variability are significant**.  The screws exhibit a wide range of sizes (M4–M8, with head diameters from 7 mm to 13 mm) and diverse types (six main categories), which leads to high inter-class similarity. In addition, deformation, wear, and other physical conditions introduce significant intra-class variations in appearance.  
**(2)Environmental interference further complicates detection**. The disassembly environment often involves drastic illumination changes, motion-induced image blur from the robot, and partial occlusion or incomplete capture of the target objects, all of which increase the difficulty of accurate screw detection.  
Consequently, MCSD provides a challenging benchmark for researchers to objectively evaluate and compare the performance and robustness of their screw detection models.
